# Controlled competition pipelines

These five pipelines exercise the competition using operator-controlled
accounts. They share the public sample's PDF ingestion and artifact schema,
with different extraction algorithms:

| Pipeline | Method |
| --- | --- |
| `full_document` | One complete-document extraction call |
| `section_map` | Independent extraction from document portions, followed by exact deduplication |
| `evidence_first` | Select and verify quotations, then express findings |
| `verify_findings` | Draft findings, then audit them against the full source |
| `results_focus` | Retrieve result-bearing spans before extraction |

All calls use the worker's scoped gateway key. Quotes must occur in their
declared source spans; malformed or unsupported outputs fail validation.
No evaluation paper IDs, expected answers or private provider keys are bundled.

Build using a private participant manifest with five entries containing
`wallet`, `coldkey`, `hotkey` and `team_id`:

```sh
python scripts/build_testnet_pipelines.py \
  --participants /private/path/participants.json \
  --output /private/path/packages
```

The build creates one wheel and competition manifest per account, plus
`packages.json` with hashes. Each wheel contains only its selected strategy.
Shared public source can be supplied to the normal duplicate candidate scanner;
duplicate checks and manual linkage review remain enabled. These accounts test
the workflow and do not demonstrate five independent operators.
